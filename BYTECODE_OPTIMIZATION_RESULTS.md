# IthacaFactory Bytecode Optimization Results

## Summary

By storing only the keccak256 hash of creation codes instead of the full creation code, we achieved a significant reduction in the IthacaFactory contract's bytecode size.

## Results

- **Original bytecode size**: 76,107 characters (~38 KB)
- **Optimized bytecode size**: 6,941 characters (~3.5 KB)
- **Reduction**: ~91% smaller bytecode

## Changes Made

### Before (Storing full creation code)
```solidity
function deployOrchestrator(address pauseAuthority, bytes32 salt) public returns (address) {
    bytes memory bytecode = abi.encodePacked(type(Orchestrator).creationCode, abi.encode(pauseAuthority));
    return _deploy(bytecode, salt);
}
```

### After (Storing only hash, validating calldata)
```solidity
// Store hashes at deployment
bytes32 private immutable ORCHESTRATOR_CREATION_CODE_HASH;

constructor() {
    ORCHESTRATOR_CREATION_CODE_HASH = keccak256(type(Orchestrator).creationCode);
}

// Validate provided creation code against stored hash
function deployOrchestrator(
    address pauseAuthority,
    bytes32 salt,
    bytes calldata creationCode
) public returns (address) {
    if (keccak256(creationCode) != ORCHESTRATOR_CREATION_CODE_HASH) {
        revert InvalidCreationCode();
    }
    bytes memory bytecode = abi.encodePacked(creationCode, abi.encode(pauseAuthority));
    return _deploy(bytecode, salt);
}
```

## Trade-offs

### Pros:
- **91% reduction in bytecode size** - Significant gas savings on deployment
- **Still deterministic** - CREATE2 addresses remain predictable
- **Security maintained** - Creation code is validated against stored hash

### Cons:
- **Increased calldata costs** - Callers must provide the full creation code
- **More complex API** - Functions now require additional parameters
- **Off-chain dependency** - Callers need access to the creation code

## Gas Impact

- **Factory deployment**: Much cheaper due to smaller bytecode
- **Contract deployments via factory**: Slightly more expensive due to:
  - Additional calldata costs
  - Hash verification overhead
  
However, the factory is deployed once while contract deployments happen many times, so the trade-off depends on usage patterns.

## Conclusion

This optimization is highly effective for reducing factory contract size, especially beneficial when:
- Factory needs to be deployed on many chains
- Factory bytecode approaches contract size limits
- Deployment costs need to be minimized

The approach maintains security through hash verification while dramatically reducing on-chain storage requirements.
